        The camp was built in 1940 and lasted until 1945. During that time, more than 17,000 Austrians suffered there. It's a sad part of history that reminds us about the terrible things that happened during World War II. <br><br>

        <div class="title">Recorded Data Distribution</div>
        To analyze the information, we're concentrating on the details where we know whether the victims survived or not. Out of all the recorded data, which amounts to 17,532 entries, this specific subset comprises 7,232 entries, making up approximately 41.3% of the total.

        The age of the prisoners at the camp varied widely, spanning from a few months to 88 years. However, the majority fell within the age range of 30 to 60 years old.

        Younger prisoners, aged 15 to 30, had the best chance of surviving, while those aged 45 to 70 had a moderate survival rate, and those over 75 had the lowest survival rate.

        This chart shows age on the x-axis and survival rate on the y-axis. Each dot's color shows gender, and its size represents the total number of prisoners in that group.<br><br>
When focusing on survival rates, we notice that 24-year-old females had the highest rate at 62.5%(thereâ€™s a tooltip). If you observe closely, you might see the pattern in the graph. The highest point appears to be in the age range of 20 to 25.
